objective:
generate prime number
plot the graph for prime numbers using discovery time and prime number

solution:
i have created three files which uses different methods to store data
1] "primecsv" generated number from start ie 1 and write those numbers in file 
	
	issues:
		i have found out that it is the fastest way among all 3 files but microsoft excel cnnot display the complete file as record is above 1.4 million which is its limit so i moved on to the second approach.
	advantages:
		it is fast

2]"primecsv-large" genrates the number starting from a "671998030559713968361666935769" 30 digit long prime number and genrate other prime numbers 
	
	issues:
		currently testing it
		test 1 failed going to find the issues cureently working on req 3
		continue with small prime numbers now and scaling it later

3]"primedb" generates the number from start and write those number in sqllite database

	issues:
		it takes time to store the numbers in database 
	advantages:
		it can handle records upto 3.4 TB so random number can be stored and not limits on data size
